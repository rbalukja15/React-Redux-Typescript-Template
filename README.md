# React-Redux-Typescript Template/Boilerplate
This is an extended template/boilerplate to get started with React and Typescript.

# What is this boilerplate about?
This project has all the required features to get started with React, Typescript and Redux.
Firstly when I started using Redux with Typescript, it was a real pain. After I got used to it, it became a necessity.
So I created this template so beginners in React-Redux Typescript can have a head-start in their projects.
I also added some 'good to have' features.

# Tech Stack
This boilerplate includes:
1. React
2. Redux
3. Typescript
4. Formik used with Yup
5. Material-UI used for components
6. Sass styling
7. Prettier/Eslint config

# Extras
I have also included some extra features:
1. An axios interceptor
2. Google fonts
3. Some widely used utils/helpers.
4. Light/Dark Material-UI Theme
5. A login page

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
